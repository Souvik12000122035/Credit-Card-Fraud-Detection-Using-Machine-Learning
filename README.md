# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE), ensemble learning (Random Forest), and real-time prediction interfaces. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and the solution focuses on building a reliable classifier with strong generalization capabilities and low false-positive rates.
